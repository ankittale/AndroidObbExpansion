### Android APK Expansion

Google Play requires that the compressed APK that users download be no more than 100MB. For most apps, this is plenty of space for all the app's code and assets. However, some apps need more space for high-fidelity graphics, media files, or other large assets. Previously, if your app's compressed download size exceeded 100MB, you had to host and download the additional resources yourself when the user opens the app. Hosting and serving the extra files can be costly, and the user experience is often less than ideal. To make this process easier for you and more pleasant for users, Google Play allows you to attach two large expansion files that supplement your APK.
